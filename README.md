## Abstract
This study delves into the analysis of Google Search Console data obtained from an industrial equipment company headquartered in Barcelona. Over a three-month period, queries in Spanish, English, and French were scrutinized, reflecting the company's multilingual online presence. **Key metrics such as clicks, impressions, click-through rates (CTRs), and search result positions were analyzed to uncover patterns and inform strategic decisions*** for enhancing online visibility and engagement.

## Datasets used

For this study we are going to be using data downloaded from the Google Search Console property of an industrial equipment company. The data covers the last 3 months (14-11-2023 / 14-02-2024). When downloading data from Google Search Console, you get a .zip with the following files:

*'Consultas.csv'*: An overview of the performance of all the queries the page has been found for.

*'Dispositivos.csv'*: An overview of the performance of all device types the page has been found in.

*'Fechas.csv'*: An overview of the performance of the page in every day during the 3 months.

*'Páginas.csv'*: An overview of the performance of every page.

*'Países.csv'*: An overview of the performance of the page in every country.

The company analyzed is from Barcelona and works with overhead cranes and industrial lifting equipment. The main page is in Spanish but it is translated to English and French, so in the data there are queries in those three languages.
